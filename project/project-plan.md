# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
The impact of Amazon deforestation on Brazil's carbon footprint

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How does the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest affect CO₂ emissions in Brazil?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Forests play a key role in climate change mitigation by absorbing CO₂ from the atmosphere and storing it as carbon. Tropical rainforests, such as the Amazon, are particularly effective in this regard, absorbing far more CO₂ than native forests. The Amazon is the largest tropical rainforest in the world and plays a key role in the global carbon cycle. Around 60 per cent of the Amazon is located in Brazil, making the country a key player in the fight against climate change.

This project investigates how deforestation in the Amazon affects Brazilian CO₂ emissions by analysing deforestation and emissions data over time. The aim is to show the links between rainforest deforestation and rising CO₂ emissions in Brazil. This analysis helps to clarify the importance of the Amazon for the global climate and to understand how important protecting this ecosystem is for reducing CO₂ emissions.


## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Degradation
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbogernetto/brazilian-amazon-rainforest-degradation
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbogernetto/brazilian-amazon-rainforest-degradation?select=def_area_2004_2019.csv
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset contains the deforestation area (km²) by year and state of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, from 2004 to 2019. 

### Datasource2: Emissions by Country
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022?select=GCB2022v27_MtCO2_flat.csv
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset contains detailed information on global CO₂ emissions at country level, including emissions from various sources such as coal, oil, gas, cement production and flaring, as well as a breakdown of per capita emissions, from 1750 to 2021.
